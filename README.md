# predmachlearn-014

This project is about doing machine learning, traning some models on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset, to predict the manner in which paticipants did the exercise. <br>

The data for this project come from this source: <br>

You can directly view the HTML in the following link: <br>
But sometimes this link doesn't work (I don't know why), then you will need to download the html file and open it on a browser.<br>
